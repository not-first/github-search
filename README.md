## Setup

Install the extension, and access the extensions options in the chrome extensions menu `Details > Extension Options` or right-clicking on the extension's icon and selecting `options`.

Insert a valid token with the `repo` (for listing private repos) and `read:user` (for listing starred repos) permissions. Check which results you would like to appear, and the automatic update frequency.
